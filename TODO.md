# Lift TODO list

## Filter meetings

Add a tab selector in the bottom of the Meetings list to filter:
- LIVE: Meetings that are active
- SOON: Meetings that are not yet active
- PAST: Meetings that are finished but not removed
- ALL: All meetings

Order: ALL - LIVE (default) - SOON - PAST

--> Question: How to manage when the conference state change ? (the only to obtain this new state is to request this conference list to the server)

## Display error area

When there is an error connecting the server, the default message is displayed: "No Meeting...". 

Add a grey area, with a text: "Not connected, check your parameters!", 
This message is not visible when connection is ok and there is no meeting yet

## Google connection

Link Lift to the Google account of the user in order to:
- Invite a google contact to a meeting
- Synchronize the meeting with the Google calendar of the user

## Conferences order

Each conferences list should be ordered.
